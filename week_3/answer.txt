What are the key differences between a client and a server in socket programming?
client:
- user-side of the interface
- multiple instances can be ran
- initiates the communications between client and server

server:
- stays open
- listens for requests from the client
- provides resources to the client

How could we modify the server to send custom messages based on client requests?
The parsed request from the client should be read by the server and through either logical configurations or from a pre-programed database of queries. The response should be sent back to the client.
